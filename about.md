## My Journey

My journey spans diverse experiences across various domains, beginning in Ireland and leading me to the bustling city of Atlanta. As a professional, I specialize in Scrum, Agile, Privacy by Design, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML). Leveraging these diverse methodologies and frameworks, I've contributed significantly to driving successful product development.

Currently, I'm managing multiple product initiatives at OneTrust as a Product Manager for Global Privacy Data Platform Products and AI Governance. Here, my strategic insights have led to the creation and launch of the OneTrust AI Governance Product from scratch, which was readily adopted by all customers due to its robust capabilities in managing AI-related risks.

Before joining OneTrust, I was part of WarnerMedia, where as a Technical Product Manager for NBA Digital, I developed and launched an innovative mobile app feature that boosted daily active users by 10%.

## My Academic Achievements

My prowess in the tech domain is backed by a solid academic foundation. I hold dual Master's degrees in Computer Information Systems and Mechanical Engineering, both earned Summa Cum Laude. My Master's research thesis was awarded the highest grade, marking my exceptional academic achievements.

## Beyond Work

Outside of professional commitments, I'm an active sports enthusiast. As the captain of the Gaelic Football team of Atlanta, I led a 60-person squad to become USA National Champions in 2018.

In addition to sports, I believe in giving back to the community. I serve as a Community Officer for the Irish Network of Atlanta, and we've successfully raised over $500k for charities in the Atlanta metro.
