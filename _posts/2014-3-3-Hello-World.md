Hi there! My name is Laurence McNally and I am delighted to welcome you to my blog. Let me introduce myself a little bit before we delve into the nitty-gritty of the tech world.

First and foremost, I am a Product Line Manager and a tech enthusiast who loves to transform raw ideas into fully functional products. My journey began in Ireland, and I've since made my way to Atlanta, GA, where I've been dabbling in product management, engineering, and machine learning.

I'm a self-proclaimed 'techie' with a strong background in Scrum, Agile, and Privacy by Design. I also have a knack for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). These skills and methodologies are my toolkit for driving successful product development in the fast-paced startup environment I thrive in.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work with an amazing team at OneTrust. Together, we launched the OneTrust AI Governance Product from scratch. This innovative product revolutionized privacy adherence by automating Privacy by Design assessments within product development workflows. Our accomplishment didn't stop there; we built an entire product module advancing ethical AI usage significantly.

Before that, I had an exhilarating stint at WarnerMedia where I helped boost daily active users by 10% through the development and launch of an innovative mobile app feature. While at WarnerMedia, I was also a Machine Learning Developer Intern, and my team and I developed a machine learning model predicting user behavior during ad breaks, increasing user retention by a whopping 60%.

My foray into tech was greatly influenced by my educational background. I hold dual Master's degrees in Computer Information Systems and Mechanical Engineering, both of which I earned Summa Cum Laude, which speaks to my drive for excellence and passion for learning.

Apart from my tech journey, I have an affinity for sports as well. I captained the Gaelic Football team of Atlanta to become USA National Champions in 2018. In my free time, I also serve as a Community Officer for the Irish Network of Atlanta, where we've managed to raise hundreds of thousands for charities in the Atlanta metro.

In this blog, you can expect a blend of technical insights, product management experiences, and occasional glimpses into my interests beyond the tech world. Here's to an enriching journey of sharing and learning!

Happy reading!
